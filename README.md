[<strong>Lung and Colon Cancer Detection with HPC (Discovery):</strong>](https://github.com/varshahindupur09/Cancer-Detection-with-High-Performance-Computing-HPC)
Developed a high-performance cancer detection system leveraging CUDA-enabled GPU acceleration and parallel processing for lung and colon cancer prediction. Optimized with Dask, DDP, Model Parallelism, and AMP to enhance scalability, convergence, and efficiency across serial, distributed, and hybrid execution modes.

[<strong>AirCast: An AI-powered air quality forecasting app</strong>(https://github.com/varshahindupur09/AirCast-Predicting-Air-Quality-Using-Machine-Learning)
 Developed an app to predict air quality using machine learning algorithms. 
The system leveraged streaming data stored in AWS S3, which was preprocessed in PostgreSQL. LSTM models were used to forecast air quality, achieving an RMSE of 0.8. 
The project was designed to assist in predicting hazardous air conditions for different geographical regions.
It is built using LSTM, streaming data, and AWS S3. Backend services built for Microservices architecture were to connection to database using SQLAlchemy (ORM), adhoc and batch data processing, APIs (syncronous RESTful), and deployment scripts.
Built UI in using React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS.
