## Generative AI Projects (Key Projects)

[<strong>Scalable Real-Time Sensitive Data Protection System</strong>](https://github.com/varshahindupur09/Sensitive-Data-Shield-AI-Anomaly-Detection-Platform)
Engineered a high-performance system utilizing TensorFlow's TFAutoModelForTokenClassification for real-time detection and prevention of sensitive data exposure in user interactions and AI-generated responses. Built with GKE, Helm, FastAPI, Go, React, Grafana, and PostgreSQL for scalability, security, and compliance in AI-driven environments.

[<strong>The Weather Explorer: Interactive Weather Data Platform</strong>](https://github.com/varshahindupur09/Weather-Explorer-Interactive-Weather-Data-Visualization)
Developed a scalable, real-time weather data platform with an ETL pipeline (Airflow, Docker) to process and validate data from SEVIR, GOES, and NEXRAD (AWS S3). Built a secure, interactive visualization tool (Streamlit, FastAPI) for exploring weather trends by year, hour, station, and day, with user authentication for controlled access. Powered by Python, AWS, Airflow, Docker, and FastAPI for reliability and performance.

## Software Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Engineering and MLOps Projects

[<strong>Lung and Colon Cancer Detection with HPC (Discovery):</strong>](https://github.com/varshahindupur09/Cancer-Detection-with-High-Performance-Computing-HPC)
Developed a high-performance cancer detection system leveraging CUDA-enabled GPU acceleration and parallel processing for lung and colon cancer prediction. Optimized with Dask, DDP, Model Parallelism, and AMP to enhance scalability, convergence, and efficiency across serial, distributed, and hybrid execution modes.

[<strong>AirCast: An AI-powered air quality forecasting app</strong>(https://github.com/varshahindupur09/AirCast-Predicting-Air-Quality-Using-Machine-Learning)
 Developed an app to predict air quality using machine learning algorithms. 
The system leveraged streaming data stored in AWS S3, which was preprocessed in PostgreSQL. LSTM models were used to forecast air quality, achieving an RMSE of 0.8. 
The project was designed to assist in predicting hazardous air conditions for different geographical regions.
It is built using LSTM, streaming data, and AWS S3. Backend services built for Microservices architecture were to connection to database using SQLAlchemy (ORM), adhoc and batch data processing, APIs (syncronous RESTful), and deployment scripts.
Built UI in using React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS.
